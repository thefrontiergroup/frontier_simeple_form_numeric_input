# Frontier SimpleForm Numeric Input

This is an enhanced version of the SimpleForm::Inputs::NumericInput that uses numericality validations on the form's model to determine min and max for an input.

To use this gem, you simply need to install it. It will override the behaviour of any numeric inputs already in your application.
